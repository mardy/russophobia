# Denouncing Russophobia

After February 24th, 2022, the world has seen an unprecedented wave of hatred
against anything Russian, including its people and even culture.

In the IT world, this has concretized in a number of companies singling out
Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, while happily continuing to do business
with other countries who have also broken international law and caused hundred
of thousands, if not millions, deaths.

Eventually, the war will be finally over. These companies will return to do
business as usual, and hope that everyone will forget about their position, in
the same way as hundreds of companies were making business with Nazi Germany
during World War II and then just washed off their past as if nothing happened.

This page aims to maintain memory about companies who have engaged in
russophobia, and also present companies which have, on the opposite, standed
out as an example of solidarity and humanity for everybody affected by these
terrible events.

## List of russophobic companies

Here is a list of companies and organisations who have decided to penalize
Russian users in response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine. A company is
deemed to be “russophobic” if it has taken steps against the Russian nation,
that it hasn't taken against other nations who have operated similarly. To make
a concrete example, if a company has decided to leave the Russian market after
February 24th, 2022, but has nothing to say against invasions by other
countries (such as the U.S.A., Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc.), this is a case of
double standards which is hard not to classify as russophobic. Of course, if
the decision to abandon the Russian business is *entirely* due to financial or
logistic issues, then the company should not be in this list (see for example
the LEGO company, who [left the business citing major force
reasons](https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2022/march/statement-on-ukraine-russia)).
Also, Ukrainian companies cannot be defined “russophobic“, since it's their own
country to be invaded, and one can not speak of double standards in such a
case.

## The good ones

Here's a list of websites and companies who have reacted in a noteworthy way.

Site / Company | Announcement | Notes
---|---|---
Flickr & SmugMug | [Statement image](https://flickr.com/photos/flickr/51937987646/in/datetaken/) | The invasion has been called “unlawful” (which every war is), but there's no political judgement; just good words of encouragement for everybody affected. Russian customers who have been unable to renew their subscriptions because of the financial block against Russia have been renewed for free at the company's expenses.
Zorin OS | [Blog post](https://blog.zorin.com/2022/03/10/zorin-os-16-1-released-support-for-ukraine/) | Standing with all the affected people, no politics, no judgement. Donating money to the displaced families. Considering that the authors of Zorin OS have Ukrainian origins, this is especially worth a praise.
